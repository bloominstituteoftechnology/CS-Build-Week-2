# CS Build Week 2

For your second CS Build Week, you and a small team will be competing against your fellow CS students in the ***Lambda Treasure Hunt***! To succeed, you will need to apply knowledge you've learned throughout your entire tenure at Lambda School -- CS, Labs and main track -- to efficiently traverse an island maze, collect treasure, solve puzzles, unearth powerful artifacts and more. Glory and prizes await the victors!

## Roles

Each team must have a minimum of one Backend and one Frontend developer. The responsibilities will be as follows:

### Backend

As the backend developer, you will be implementing an automated traversal server. By sending POST requests to our LambdaMUD Island server and processing the results, your server will allow your team's characters to move and collect treasure at all hours of the day and night. The teams with efficient traversal and treasure collection algorithms will find themselves prosperous.

### Frontend

As a frontend developer, you will be building a map of the island and implementing an interface to move your characters manually. You may do this by interfacing with your own backend server, connecting directly to the LambdaMUD Island server, or some combination of both (recommended).

The gods presiding over LambdaMUD Island favor beauty and elegance. Those with aesthetic interfaces might find themselves mysteriously blessed with powers throughout the week.
